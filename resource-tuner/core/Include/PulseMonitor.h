 * \details Runs as a Daemon Thread and Periodically (Every 60 seconds) checks if any of the Clients with
 *          Active or Pending Requests with the Resource Tuner Server have died or terminated.
 *          When such a Client is Found it is added to the Garbage Collector Queue, so that it
 *          can be cleaned up.
 *
 *          Pulse Monitor Flow:\n\n
 *          1) The Pulse Monitor, retrieves the list of Clients (i.e. clients with Outstanding Requests)
 *             from the ClientDataManager.\n\n
 *          2) Next, it checks if the /proc/<pid>/status file exists for this Process or not. If it does
 *             not exist, it indicates that the Process has been terminated.\n\n
 *          3) If it detects a Dead Client, the Pulse Monitor adds it to the Garbage Collector Queue,
 *             for further cleanup (Refer ClientGarbageCollector for more details regarding Cleanup).\n\n
